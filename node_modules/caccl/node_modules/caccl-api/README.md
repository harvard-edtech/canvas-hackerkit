# caccl-api
A class that defines a set of Canvas endpoints that can be easily accessed. Each endpoint is equipped with the appropriate pre- and post-processing steps to make the Canvas endpoints "behave". For instance, _getSubmissions()_ fetches student submissions and removes the test student's submission in post-processing.
